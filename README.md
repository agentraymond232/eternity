### Firebase
After last years Google I/O, Firebase was upgraded and become an even more important role in the range of Google services available. Now properly integrated with Google Services, Firebase offers developers much more than than just a database for "personal" projects.

This project demonstrates how you can implement Firebase in an Android project with clean coding practices.

The source code for this Firebase sample application is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ashdavies/eternity) 

Based upon the What If web comic [#34](https://what-if.xkcd.com/34/) by Randal Munroe.
